Python code use in Can gravitational lensing help to detect gravitational waves project

This project this for final project in Kamnoetvidya Science Academy (KVIS)

# Abstract
Binary systems are common systems of stellar objects found in the universe. Binary systems can cause gravitational lensing events due to their mass and lose energy in the form of gravitational waves. Even though both phenomena are from the same system, gravitational waves are much rarer to detect due to their low amplitude. This lends to our question of whether there are some gravitational wave events that might happen but we cannot detect due to limitations of the detector. In this research we aim to find the relationship between gravitational lensing and gravitational waves through light curves and strain signals to help predict the emit of gravitational waves from binary system by analysis light curves using Python simulation to model the system and graph.

#Note
- In our simulation will not consider the change in the angular speed when binary system loss it energy.
- The orbit is consider as circle, where ellipticity = 0.
- The orbit have inclination angle of 90 degree so, it look like a plane seen from earth.
