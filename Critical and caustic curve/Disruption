Python code use for simulating critical and caustic curve of gravitational lensing from binary system in 4 condition
-rippid rotation conserved energy binary -> cariticle_fixorbit_rippid
-normal rotation conserved energy binary -> cariticle_fixorbit_normalRotation
-rippid rotation with energy loss binary -> 
-normal rotation with energy loss binary -> cariticle_fixorbit_rippid_loss
